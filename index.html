        <p>This unit introduces a slightly special troubleshooting method. This is how to use the recursion function, which is a function that calls itself. The learning goal of this unit is to develop the ability to think in different ways to solve a single problem while learning and practicing recursion.
            The JavaScript grammar learned in Section 1 is the basic knowledge required for recursion in the future, so you should familiarize yourself with the concepts sufficiently. In particular, if you do not have basic concepts about conditional and looping statements, you may have difficulty learning recursion.
